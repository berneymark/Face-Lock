# Secret Keeper
## MSA 2019 Project

### Description
This project was done as apart of the first phase of MSA. I chose the Cognitive Services project, which involves making a web app in react using Azure Cognitive Services to add smart capabilities.

### Usage
My particular project is a 'Secret Keeper'. When you open this you will be welcomed to a webcam view of yourself and a button. Upon pushing that button the user will have their face compared to an image of a face to check if they are the 'owner' of the secret. Either way an alert will pop up either telling the user the secret or exclaiming that they are not the correct user.

**NOTE: In order to test this you will need to use a photo of myself to test for a correct face which I have included in this repo as `test.jpg`.**
